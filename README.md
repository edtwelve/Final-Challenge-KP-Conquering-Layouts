This is the development of the last project in the Conquering Responsive Layouts bootcamp from Kevin Powell. It consists of a landing page that describes characteristics and perks of what could be a course in Responsive Layouts.

It's done with HTML and CSS with a responsive nature, also optimized for mobile and tablet. *It contains Grid and Flexbox elements*.
